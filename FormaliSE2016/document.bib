  efficient code generation for Lustre specifications.  The
  approach works by treating all Boolean variables within the
  specification as describing a state space, and then building a
  finite state automaton of that state space.  In other words, a
  node of the FSA represents one or more assignments to the set
  of boolean variables of the specification.  Normally, all
  variables have to be recomputed, but this approach allows
  the assignments to be encoded directly into the structure of the
  FSA.

  In order to keep the size of the FSA from blowing up, they
  introduce ``demand-driven'' control synthesis, which groups sets
  of states into equivalence classes in terms of how they affect
  the output of the machine.  If several states all cause the same
  sequence of outputs to be generated for all inputs, then they
  are equivalent and can be collapsed into a single state.

  The authors do not make any correctness arguments about the
  transformations, but they seem intuitively obvious.  Proving
  these optimizations correct using a fully formal system would be
  a daunting task.

  The underlying power of Lustre is very similar to that of RSML-e,
  while having a much smaller semantics.  Lustre can be
  translated to an imperative language like C using a
  straightforward approach.  This paper describes a significant
  optimization of the translated code.  It creates an automaton
  out of the possible states of all Boolean state variables.  For
  example, if a specification had three Booleans, then some
  example states would be {x=t; y=f; z=t}, {x=f; y=f; z=t }.
  Then, rather than compute the value of each boolean variable, it
  computes the next state of the automaton, which describes the
  values of all boolean variables.  Because of the syntax of
  Lustre, specifications must be both complete and consistent, so
  there is no non-determinism in the automaton.

  This optimization could also be applied to RSML-e, if we adopt
  the execution semantics that is currently used by the Nimbus
  toolset (which ensures determinism and completeness of macros
  and state variable assignments, provided functions are
  complete).
  
  One issue that they do not consider is applying the same
  approach to enumerated values.  This would be the area that
  could provide significant benefit for RSML-e specifications.  If
  we could create a true automaton out of the enumerated
  variables, we could maintain much of the execution of the
  specification as a finite-state automata.  Of course, it would
  be impossible to understand, if bugs arose.  }}
